Revised goal:
    - Build a basic website with social media and web3 properties:

        social aspect:
            - Users must have a profile picture, username, name, bio
            - Users are able to post
            - Users can react and comment on each other's posts
            - Users recieve confirmation emails for important actions
        web 3 aspect:
            - users will have access to special "medals" (reddit style reaction buttons)
            - users will be able to sync metamask


    - Modularise the components built for this project along the way to make them reusable for projects with completely different goals.


    - SEE WHETHER MATERIAL UI CAN HELP.
